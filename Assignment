\section{ENUMERATE}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Get Organized. Making a plan for what you're going to do and when you're going to do it will make sure you're always ahead of the curve - literally. 
    \item Don't multitask. Studies have shown that multitasking is physically impossible. 
    \item Divide it up. Studying isn't fun to begin with, and forcing yourself through a study marathon will only make it worse. Dividing your work into manageable chunks and rewarding yourself when you finish each chunk will make studying (more) fun.
\end{enumerate}
\section{ITEMIZE}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Sleep. Don't underestimate the importance of those eight hours of zzz's every night! Getting a good night's rest will sharpen your focus and improve your working memory.
    \item Set a schedule. Do you work better right after school or after you've eaten dinner? Are you more productive in 90-minute blocks or half-hour spurts? Find a schedule that works for you, and stick to it.
    \item ake notes. Taking notes will not only keep you more engaged during class, but will also help you narrow down what you need to study when exam time rolls around. It's much easier to reread your notes than to reread your entire textbook!
    \subsection{USING OTHER BULLETS}
    \item[$\Theta$] Study. This one might be obvious, but did you know that there's a right and a wrong way to study? Review your material several days ahead of time, in small chunks, and in different manners (for example, write flashcards one day and take practice tests the next). In other words, don't cram. 
    \item[$$\#$$]  Manage your study space. Find a place that will maximize your productivity. Look for places away from the television and other distractions. Whether it's your local library or just the desk in your bedroom, set aside a study space that you'll want to spend time in. 
    \item [$\ast$]Find a study group. Sitting down with a group of people who are learning the same things as you is a great way to go over confusing class material or prepare for a big test. You can quiz each other, reteach material, and make sure that everyone is on the same page. After all, teaching someone else is the best way to learn. 
    \item [$-$] Find a study group. Sitting down with a group of people who are learning the same things as you is a great way to go over confusing class material or prepare for a big test.

\section{PARAGRAPH}
Acomputer is a digital electronic machine that can be programmed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations (computation) automatically. Modern computers can perform generic sets of operations known as programs. These programs enable computers to perform a wide range of tasks. A computer system is a "complete" computer that includes the hardware, operating system (main software), and peripheral equipment needed and used for "full" operation. This term may also refer to a group of computers that are linked and function together, such as a computer network or computer cluster. \par A broad range of industrial and consumer products use computers as control systems. Simple special-purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls are included, as are factory devices like industrial robots and computer-aided design, as well as general-purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices like smartphones. Computers power the Internet, which links billions of other computers and users.
\section{\LaTeX TABLE}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The tables in Latex are created with a combination of
    a tabular environment and the table environment. The tabular
     environments contain the actual content of the table, while
     others include the caption.
   \item How to create and customize tables like: changing size/spacing,
   combining cells, applying colour to rows or cells, and so forth.
   \item The tabular environment is the default LATEX method to create
     tables. You must specify a parameter to this environment; here
       we use {c c c} which tells LaTeX that there are three colur.
\end{itemize}
\begin{table}
    \centering
    %\caption{Friends}
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline
       S.NO  & Name & Age & Branch & Year  \\ \hline

\end{table}
\subsection{COMBINING ROWS AND COLOUMN}
\begin{itemize}
    \item [$\%$] Rows and columns can be merged to create larger table cells.To combine rows you need to add
the multirow package to your document preamble:
\end{itemize}
\begin{tabular}{ |c|c|c| } \hline
\multicolumn{3}{|c|}{cell numbers}\\ \hline
cell4 & cell5 & cell6\\ \hline
cell1&cell2&cell3\\ \hline
\multirow{2}{6em}{cellnumbers} & cell2 &cell3\\
&cell5&cell6\\ \hline

This is an assignment. We are not sharing the source code for this document- you’ll have to look up the titles of each section (Overleaf is a great source), and try to replicate the features we
demonstrate the best you can.\\

We recommend you attempt this assignment in the online Overleaf editor for the most
convenient workflow. The MacTeX distribution has all packages installed.

Some of the packages might give you troubles in your offline LATEX distribution, if so, you can
switch over to Overleaf.\\

\textbf{\huge 1.Knitting patterns}\\
\begin{large}
This class provides a very convenient way to introduce boxed diagrams. We are thus going to use our stock image a few more
times. Also, it has a few features to make knitting instructions more readable, however, we can adapt them to make prettier
documents for our purposes as well.

Look at the adjoining graph. Yes, you’ve seen it before. This \\ time, it is side by side with a paragraph! And there’s a beautiful box around it! By default, this will be a quarter of the
width of the page. If you follow the hint that is the title of this section, you won’t have to type in cumbersome code to fit in images. Also, have you noticed that the pages are much
wider? A lot of it will be clear when you read up on the knittingpatterns class. It is already available with the MacTeX distributions, and of course, online on Overleaf. If your distribution does not offer it, download it from here and copy the .cls file to the folder/directory your code is in. See the point where stuff becomes exponentially harder to do without LATEX? We daresay the rest of this assignment crosses that point. Good luck!

 Assume that $\sqrt{2}=a/b$,where a,b E Z.without loss of generality,we may assume gcd(a,b)=1.then we have

 \textbf{{$$\sqrt{2}^2={({\frac{a}{b}})^2}$$   $$ (1) $$}}\\
 \textbf{$${2}=\frac{a^2}{b^2} $$}\\
 \textbf{$${a^2}=2{b^2}$$}\\
 but then from(3), we know that ${a^2}$ is even so that a is even.but then we must have
 $$2{a^2}={b^2}$$
 so that ${b^2}$ is even,implying is even.but the $gcd(a,b)>=2$,a contradiction

finite automata. In general, a puzzle of this type has a frame like this (but possibly
with more/fewer squares and different colors):

colors)

The tiles must be arranged so that adjacent areas have matching colors. There is an
unlimited number of copies of each tile.

(a) Show how every puzzle of this type can be converted into a finite automaton \textit{M}and a string w such that \textit{M}accepts \textit{w} if and only if the puzzle has a solution.
\flushleft
(b) Apply your construction to the above instance.\\
(c) Briefly describe how this gives an \textit{O(n)} algorithm for solving puzzles of this
type.
